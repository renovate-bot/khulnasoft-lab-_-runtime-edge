# TypeScript support

The **Runtime Edge** includes TypeScript types. In fact, the library is written in TypeScript!

Just in case you need to have these types loaded as part of the global context, you can add them inside [tsconfig.json](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html):

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["@runtime-edge/types"]
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you can load them using [triple-slash directive](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/triple-slash-directives.html) as well:

```js
/// <reference types="@runtime-edge/types" />
```
