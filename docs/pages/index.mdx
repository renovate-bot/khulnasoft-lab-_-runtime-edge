# The Runtime Edge

The Runtime Edge is designed to help framework authors adopt edge computing and provide open-source tooling built on Web standards. It’s designed to be integrated into frameworks (like Next.js) and not for usage in application code. This runtime is purposefully minimal and designed for security and speed.

When your framework is built on the Runtime Edge, it runs everywhere Node.js does. When deployed to infrastructure like Vercel, frameworks like Next.js can automatically provision the optimal infrastructure for you.

The Runtime Edge is a subset of standard Web APIs, giving you compatibility and interoperability with the highest number of environments. The project is designed to be compliant with standards developed by [WinterCG](https://wintercg.org) - a community group between Vercel, Cloudflare, Deno, Shopify, and more. The term “Edge” refers to the orientation toward instant serverless compute environments and not a specific set of locations.

## Using the Runtime Edge Locally

When developing and testing locally, the Runtime Edge will polyfill Web APIs and ensure compatibility with the Node.js layer.

In production, the Runtime Edge uses the [JavaScript V8 engine](https://v8.dev/), **not** Node.js, so there is **no access** to Node.js APIs.

Get started using Runtime Edge:

- [Explore the available APIs](features/available-apis)
- [Integrate it in your project](/packages/runtime)
- [Test your code with Jest](/packages/jest-environment) or [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/config/#environment)
