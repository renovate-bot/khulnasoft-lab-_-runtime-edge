# Using the CLI

## Installation

The **Runtime Edge** can be also consumed from your terminal when you install it globally in your system:

```sh npm2yarn
npm -g install runtime-edge
```

## Usage

The CLI provides you different ways to evaluate an script with [Runtime Edge APIs](/features/available-apis) constraints.

You can just start an interactive session with `--repl`:

```bash
runtime-edge --repl
```

Evaluate an inline script with `--eval`:

```bash
runtime-edge --eval "Object.getOwnPropertyNames(this)"
```

Run a local HTTP server:

```bash
runtime-edge --listen examples/fetch.js
```

and more. In any case, you can see all this information typing `runtime-edge --help`.
