# Runtime Edge Types

The **@runtime-edge/types** package has the TypeScript global types for using Runtime Edge.

## Installation

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @runtime-edge/types
```

## Usage

If you need to have these types loaded as part of the global context, you can add them inside [tsconfig.json](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html):

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["@runtime-edge/types"]
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you can load them using [triple-slash directive](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/triple-slash-directives.html) as well:

```js
/// <reference types="@runtime-edge/types" />
```
