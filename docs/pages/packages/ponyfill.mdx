# Runtime Edge Ponyfill

The **@runtime-edge/ponyfill** package helps to have the Runtime Edge APIs available in your environment:

- When running on Runtime Edge, no polyfills will be loaded, and the native implementations will be used.
- When running on Node.js runtimes, this package will load the polyfills from [@runtime-edge/primitives](/packages/primitives).

Note this is just necessary if you want to run the same code across different environments.

## Installation

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @runtime-edge/ponyfill
```

This package includes built-in TypeScript support.

## Usage

Rather than use APIs from the global scope:

```js
const data = new TextEncoder().encode('Hello, world')
const digest = await crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', content)
```

Load them from the package instead:

```js
import { crypto, TextEncoder } from '@runtime-edge/ponyfill'

const data = new TextEncoder().encode('Hello, world')
const digest = await crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', content)
```

Any [Runtime Edge API](/features/available-apis) is available.
